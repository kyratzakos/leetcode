# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of triplets (i, j, k) such that the XOR of the subarray from i to j-1 is equal to the XOR of the subarray from j to k. This can be achieved using the properties of the XOR operation.

# Approach
1. Prefix XOR: Compute the prefix XOR for each position in the array. The prefix XOR up to index `i` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array to index `i`.
2. Utilize Prefix XOR to Find Triplets: For a triplet (i, j, k) to satisfy the condition `a==b`:
`if prefix[jâˆ’1]==prefix[k]`, it implies the condition is satisfied.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the array. The nested loops run in quadratic time.

- Space complexity:
$O(n)$ for the prefix XOR array.

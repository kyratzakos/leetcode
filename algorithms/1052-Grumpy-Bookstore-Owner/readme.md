# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of satisfied customers by strategically using the secret technique to nullify the grumpiness of the bookstore owner for a continuous period of `minutes`.

# Approach
1. Initial Satisfaction: Calculate the number of satisfied customers without using the secret technique.
2. Sliding Window Technique: Use the sliding window technique to determine the maximum additional customers that can be satisfied by using the secret technique for any consecutive `minutes`.


# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the `customers` array. We perform a single pass to calculate initial satisfaction and another pass for the sliding window.

- Space complexity:
$O(1)$, as we use a constant amount of extra space.

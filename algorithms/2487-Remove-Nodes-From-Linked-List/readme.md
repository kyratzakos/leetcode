# Intuition
We can approach this problem with a reverse traversal method. This involves traversing from the end of the list to the beginning, which allows us to easily determine the maximum value seen so far and decide if the current node should be kept or removed based on this information.

A reverse traversal can be efficiently implemented by first reversing the linked list, then processing the nodes, and finally reversing it again to restore the original order but with the specified nodes removed. This method ensures that each node is only compared to its successors in the list.



# Approach
1. Reverse the Linked List: Reverse the entire list so that we can process it from what was originally the end to the start.
2. Filter Nodes: Traverse the reversed list, keeping track of the maximum value seen so far. Only include nodes that are greater than any value seen after them (in the original list's order).
3. Reverse Again: Reverse the list a second time to restore the original order minus the removed nodes.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$O(N)$ due to three traversals of the list (two reversals and one processing pass).

- Space complexity:
$O(1)$ for the reversals, but $O(N)$ for the output list since we potentially create a new list of almost the same size.

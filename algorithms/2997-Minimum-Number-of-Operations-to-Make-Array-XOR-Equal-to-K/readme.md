# Intuition
To solve this problem efficiently using TypeScript, the approach involves working with the binary representation of the numbers and performing bitwise operations to determine the number of bit flips needed to make the XOR of the entire array equal to a given target `k`.


# Approach
1. Compute the XOR of All Array Elements: Calculate the XOR of all elements in the given array `nums`.
2. Determine the XOR Difference: Find the XOR difference between the computed XOR of the array and `k`, since this difference will tell us which bits are mismatched and need to be flipped.
3. Count the Mismatched Bits: The number of bits that need to be flipped is the number of 1's in the XOR difference. This is because each 1 in the XOR difference represents a bit that is different between the XOR of the array and `k`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$O(N)$ where $N$ is the number of elements in the array. The while loop for counting bits runs in $O(log(maxValue))$ time, but this is generally small compared to the size of the array

- Space complexity:
$O(1)$, as the space used does not depend on the size of the input array but only uses a few additional variables for computation.

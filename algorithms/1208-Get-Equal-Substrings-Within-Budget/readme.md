# Intuition
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to efficiently find the maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to match `t` with a total cost less than or equal to `maxCost`. The sliding window technique is suitable here because it allows us to maintain a window of valid substrings and expand or contract the window as needed based on the cost constraints.

# Approach
1. Sliding Window Technique: Use two pointers to represent the start and end of the current window (substring) of `s` and `t`.
2. Calculate Cost: Maintain the total cost of converting the current window of `s` to `t`.
3. Expand and Contract Window: Expand the window by moving the end pointer. If the total cost exceeds `maxCost`, contract the window by moving the start pointer until the total cost is within `maxCost`.
4. Track Maximum Length: Track the maximum length of valid substrings encountered during the process.


# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the strings `s` and `t`. Each character is processed at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when contracting it).

- Space complexity:
$O(1)$, as only a fixed amount of extra space is used for pointers and counters.

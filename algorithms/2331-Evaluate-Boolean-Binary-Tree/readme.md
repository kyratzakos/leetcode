# Intuition
To solve the problem of evaluating a full binary tree with given properties, we need to traverse the tree and evaluate it based on the specified rules for leaf and non-leaf nodes. We can use a recursive approach to evaluate each node starting from the root.

# Approach
1. Base Case: If the node is a leaf node (value 0 or 1), return its boolean value directly (`0` as `false` and `1` as `true`).
2. Recursive Case: If the node is a non-leaf node (value 2 for OR or value 3 for AND), recursively evaluate its left and right children, then apply the node's boolean operation to the results of its children.
3. Return the Result: The result of evaluating the root node will be the final result.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once.

- Space complexity:
$O(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack. For a full binary tree, the height is $O(logn)$.

# Intuition
To solve the problem of finding if an array nums is special (i.e., if there exists a number x such that there are exactly x numbers in nums that are greater than or equal to x), we can follow these steps:

# Approach
1. Sort the Array: Sorting the array helps in counting how many numbers are greater than or equal to any given number.
2. Iterate and Count: Iterate over the sorted array to find the number `x` such that exactly `x` numbers are greater than or equal to `x`.
3. Edge Cases: Consider edge cases where the array might have very few elements.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
The time complexity is $O(nlogn+n^2)$ due to sorting the array and then iterating through the array for each possible value of `x`. This can be optimized further.


- Space complexity:
$O(1)$ additional space is used aside from the input array.

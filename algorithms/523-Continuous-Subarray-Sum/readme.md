# Intuition
To solve the problem of finding a good subarray in `nums` where the subarray's length is at least two and its sum is a multiple of `k`, we can use a hashmap to efficiently track prefix sums and their remainders when divided by `k`. The key idea is to use the property that if two prefix sums have the same remainder when divided by `k`, the subarray between these two sums has a sum that is a multiple of `k`.

# Approach
1. Initialize HashMap: Use a hashmap to store the remainder of the prefix sum divided by `k` and its corresponding index.
2. Iterate Through Array: Calculate the prefix sum as you iterate through the array.
3. Check Remainders: For each prefix sum, compute its remainder when divided by `k`. If the remainder has been seen before and the distance between the current index and the stored index is at least 2, a good subarray is found.
4. Handle Edge Cases: Include a base case for remainder 0 to handle subarrays starting from the beginning.


# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`. We iterate through the array once.

- Space complexity:
$O(min(n,k))$, as we store remainders and their indices in the hashmap. The size of the hashmap is at most the minimum of $n$ and $k$.
